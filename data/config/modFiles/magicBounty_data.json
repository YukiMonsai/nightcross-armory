		"job_description": "A popular virtual singer from Nightcross has retired. Normally, this wouldn't be newsworthy to a starship captain (except a devotee of this particular artist), but leaked behind-the-scenes footage shows that the singer was actually an AI core all along, prompting a COMSEC investigation into the matter. Coincidentally, certain interests within Nightcross Armory Corporation have posted a bounty on an unusual prototype that has been painted garish colors and heavily modified by the errant AI core, escorted by a fleet of devoted fans. It would be a shame if an independent captain just happened to catch this one before the Hegemony.",

		"job_intel_failure": "Kasane Teto's flagship has won you over with its awe-inspiring firepower. And naturally, you have a certain AI core to pilot it - wait, is that a pear!?",
