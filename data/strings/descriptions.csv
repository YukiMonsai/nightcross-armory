nightcross_nightcrossplanet,CUSTOM,"A formerly sterile husk of a world that nonetheless found a brief moment of habitability during the short lifecycle of its host star. Post-collapse, the world is controlled by warlord states ruling over shielded dome-cities, what remains of Nightcross Armory Corporation being its sole contribution to the wider sector.",,,,
na_orbital_databank,CUSTOM,"The last vestige of the Nightcross planetary government and the seat of the exiled planetary council. While most of the est. 6 mil population remained planetside during the collapse, the space elevator continues to provide a pathway for the rich and the fortunate to escape the fallout.",,,,
na_graveyard_station,CUSTOM,"In the aftermath of the first AI war, a loose conglomeration of junkers and refugees took up shelter on this formerly derelict station. As the population swelled during the fall of Nightcross, the NCA Corporation chose to purchase the habitat and build out its orbital facilities to include a shipyard and refineries. Labor costs are quite low, as most residents have little remaining in the way of possessions and property.",,,,
na_gordion,CUSTOM,"The former headquarters of Nightcross Armory Corporation. More of a glorified office complex rather than a habitat in its own right, its significance was largely overshadowed by Graveyard station as the company moved most of its planetside assets into safer orbits.",,,,
na_antarctica,CUSTOM,"An outpost built to house a small company of prospectors sponsored by Nightcross Armory Corporation post-collapse. After the fall of Nightcross proper, the Company repossessed the largely-abandoned station.",,,,
na_moon,CUSTOM,"Prior to the collapse of the Nightcross planetary government, the Corporation began steadily moving assets off-planet. The evacuation of the Nightcross Armory headquarters blunted those efforts, however, and the proposed site of the new headquarters was abandoned as the Corporation switched its focus toward Graveyard Station.",,,,
na_icegiantmoon,CUSTOM,An icy world that was once the site of a well-funded prospecting operation sponsored by the Nightcross government. Most of the funding evaporated along with the system government.,,,,

na_cenotaph,CUSTOM,"A moon with a scarred surface, the subject of numerous weapons tests during Project Aria.",,,,
na_researchbase,CUSTOM,"An orbital weapons research station formerly owned by Nightcross Armory Corporation. In the immediate aftermath of the Collapse, the local management cut ties with the rest of the Corporation and began selling company resources to competitors, hoping to weather the coming storm by forming new connections. Ultimately, the gambit failed to attract meaningful investment in the remote Pascal system, and Nightcross Armory continues to dominate interstellar trade in the system. Aria Station has since fallen into the hands of various warlords fighting for control of a dead system.",,,,
wolf_rayet,CUSTOM,"A late-stage main sequence star of several suns' mass.

na_core_teto,RESOURCE,A mysterious talking fruit that happens to contain an AI persona.,,,,
na_echo,SHIP,"While Nightcross Armory Corporation eschewed carrier doctrine as a whole, projecting a decline in demand for such products in a sector brimming with increasingly lethal and destructive weaponry, the Moonbeam class nonetheless emerged during an era where multi-theater heavy strikecraft were the next frontier in weapons development.

Possessing an aerodynamic design and a hangar bay for servicing of strikecraft, the Moonbeam is able to participate in planetside operations, raining heavy and direct firepower from the skies while operating as a command hub for elite strike squadrons. In space, its advantages are readily apparent as are its weaknesses; supreme mobility at the cost of an inflexible loadout and a lightweight, fragile frame. The only saving grace for captains caught with their shields down is that much of the airframe is redundant for space operations, allowing its wings to be shot off without compromising hull integrity.",,,,
na_mare,SHIP,A heavily-armed frigate with a destroyer grade flux core and Nightcross dynamic conduit system. Its history traces to a redacted weapons program from before the collapse--the details are lost to history.,,,,
na_mare_proto,SHIP,"What appears to be an variant of the Mare Crisium-type frigate turns out to be a vastly different build. Rather than a shielded craft, the internals reflect a phase vessel centered around a highly nonstandard phase coil which is somehow missing, replaced with perfectly spherical void in the heart of the vessel. Retrofitting a standard phase coil renders the ship operational, but the mystery remains.",,,,

na_sop_proto,SHIP,"A String of Pearls-type corvette seemingly redesigned around a space for a phase coil. The coil itself appears to be missing, however, replaced with a perfectly spherical void. The vessel itself appears to be infected with a hostile program that causes malfunctions in any ship within comms range, and all attempts to remove the program have been met with failure. The computer systems show a message on boot: ""I can't stand being human like this.""",,,,
na_macula,SHIP,An experimental destroyer possessing advanced shield technology and a patented spatial distortion device to help force engagements.,,,,
na_losulci,SHIP,"Some view it as Nightcross Armory Corporation's crowning achievement; others consider it an accomplishment that such a project ever came to fruition. Arrays of overloaded flux conduits strewn across the hull are veiled in centuries-old hardlight shielding, a remnant from a time when shields required huge and vulnerable projectors. Nonetheless, despite numerous design compromises, the Lo Sulci is the largest vessel ever fielded by the Nightcross planetary navy before its unfortunate demise.",,,,

na_shieldbattery,SHIP,"A floating shield generator with an inverted operating mode, allowing it to redirect hard flux from allied vessels into its own robust (for its size) flux grid. In combat, it can weaponize this feature in order to fire EMP bolts at enemy craft, but it is a frail machine and should not be subjected to direct enemy fire.",,,,
na_fossa,SHIP,A fast attack destroyer with a robust power grid and durable shield. Its fast recharge subsystem allows it to take advantage of advanced weapons platforms pioneered by Nightcross Armory Corporation.,,,,
na_nammu,SHIP,"A dedicated support vessel, designed to aid in fleet logistics while providing missile support to fleets in combat. Its drones provide it with the ability to provide onsite repair capabilities and stabilize the shields of targets under fire.",,,,
na_tessera,SHIP,"A light cruiser designed purely for spaceborne operations, informed by learnings from the Fossa Magna's Chroma Reactor and the Moonbeam's overtuned thrusters. The Tessera Magu is a cutting-edge killing machine, fast and deadly, capable of putting its reactor into overdrive for brief periods in order to supercharge its weapons and mobility.",,,,
na_elyurias,SHIP,"Born to rain down death across vast distances, the Elyurias was the lynchpin of the Nightcross Planetary Defense Force prior to its dissolution. Equipped with an advanced combat-rated missile forge, its flux grid powered a punishing array of long-ranged weapons supported by an unending barrage of relativistic missiles. Today, the Elyurias is a rarer sight as a supporting vessel in independent battlegroups.",,,,
na_macula_proto,SHIP,"A Krun Macula-type experimental destroyer found adrift in space, seemingly retrofitted to utilize phase technology and possessing two unusual devices that presumably once functioned as phase coils. One of the devices, however, has been replaced with a perfectly spherical void. The craft functions like a normal phase ship once retrofitted with standard phase coils, but the unusual device in the other space seems to produce an unnerving effect on the crew when activated.",,,,
