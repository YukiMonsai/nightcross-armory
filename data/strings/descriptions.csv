nightcross_nightcrossplanet,CUSTOM,"A formerly sterile husk of a world that nonetheless found a brief moment of habitability during the short lifecycle of its host star. Post-collapse, the world is controlled by warlord states ruling over shielded dome-cities, what remains of Nightcross Armory Corporation being its sole contribution to the wider sector.",,,,
na_orbital_databank,CUSTOM,"The last vestige of the Nightcross planetary government and the seat of the exiled planetary council. While most of the est. 6 mil population remained planetside during the collapse, the space elevator continues to provide a pathway for the rich and the fortunate to escape the fallout.",,,,
na_graveyard_station,CUSTOM,"In the aftermath of the first AI war, a loose conglomeration of junkers and refugees took up shelter on this formerly derelict station. As the population swelled during the fall of Nightcross, the NCA Corporation chose to purchase the habitat and build out its orbital facilities to include a shipyard and refineries. Labor costs are quite low, as most residents have little left in the way of means.",,,,

na_xanthe,SHIP,"A highly unconventional design based on prototype early-model phase coils. While the performance is, on paper, superior to standard-issue coils in the sector, the esoteric design requirements result in a ship that consists of mostly phase-coils, with much of the remaining space packed with automation. Nonetheless, the Xanthe Terra fills a unique niche in the Nightcross Armory catalog, able to bring to bear significant firepower in the hands of a skilled pilot.",,,,
na_elyurias,SHIP,"Born to rain death across vast distances, the Elyurias was the lynchpin of the Nightcross Planetary Defense Force prior to its dissolution. Equipped with an advanced combat-rated missile forge, its flux grid powered a punishing array of long-ranged weapons supported by an unending barrage of relativistic missiles. Today, the Elyurias is a rarer sight as a supporting vessel in independent battlegroups.",,,,
na_macula_proto,SHIP,"A Krun Macula-type experimental destroyer found adrift in space, seemingly retrofitted to utilize phase technology and possessing two unusual devices that presumably once functioned as phase coils. One of the devices, however, has been replaced with a perfectly spherical void. The craft functions like a normal phase ship once retrofitted with standard phase coils, but the unusual device in the other space seems to produce an unnerving effect on the crew when activated.",,,,
