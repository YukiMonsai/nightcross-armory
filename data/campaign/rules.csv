""This one requires a bit of discretion,"" $personFirstName stares at you.
""High-energy events detected near the Orion-Persean abyss, $bcb_dist light-years away."" $HeOrShe carries a bleak expression. ""Word is that Tri-Tachyon stumbled upon something real interesting out there. Some kind of... Threat.""

The $rank looks around warily.

""Looks like they hired a whole merc armada to check it out. Based on what we know, they never made it back.
The reward is $bcb_reward credits and you'd have $bcb_days days to go there and find what they were looking for. Make sure none of this gets out to the wider public. You in?""",,

""Mercs. We don't know who hired them, but in all likelihood it's TriTachyon,"" $HeOrShe points to a location on the fringe of the core.
""Back from a 'business trip' to the Orion-Persean abyss. Somehow they miscalculated the supplies they needed, so they're making a stop for resupply in $bcb_systemName, $bcb_dist light-years from here.""

""Some well-to-do captain, last sighted in $bcb_systemName, $bcb_dist light-years from here. Bragged about a 'rare find' from their travels. Well, word went around and now the Corporation is having me deal with them. Head over there, take them out, and $bcb_reward credits are yours.""",,

""This one is... sparse on information."" $HeOrShe shrugs. ""But the payout is high, so I thought you might be interested.""

The full report indeed offers nothing more than a generalized threat assessment. Warnings abound, as do liability waivers and confidentiality agreements.

""The report says that 'it' was sighted in $bcb_systemName, $bcb_dist light-years away. Offers $bcb_reward credits for the job. Between you and me-""  $Rank $personName takes on a hushed tone. ""I have my suspicions about the org this is for. Be careful out there, Captain.""",,
NCACBTTOmega,NCACBTTOmegaOfferDesc,,Highlight $bcb_dist $bcb_reward $bcb_days,"""A Tri-Tachyon black project.""

The phrase hangs in the air for a moment. Self explanatory, after a fashion.

""Nothing the Corporation wants to get its hands on directly, of course,"" $HeOrShe nods. ""Just a bit of friendly competition. Courtesy of an anonymous tip.""

The report describes a mixed warfleet displaying dozensof unusual energy signatures, replete with violations of postwar agreements and arms-limitation treaties. 

""They are conducting an operation in the $bcb_systemName system, $bcb_dist light-years away. The Corporation offers $bcb_reward credits if they happen to have an unfortunate accident, Captain.""",,
